Things we used as concepts are in the ideation folder.

Matthew worked on the visualisation for the demo.

Oliver worked on a webiste UI prototype but it was unfinished.

Hugo worked on a django go-between for the website frontend and python backend - it was unfinished.

Data collection and analysis using python is found in the API Work folder.
- gen_random_subs.py outputs a list of random subreddit names
- compare_reddits.py takes two or more subreddit names and returns their similarities in a json format that is rendered by our demo website using d3.js
