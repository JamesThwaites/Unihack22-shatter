# Work Breakdown

## API integration
- user can log in and use their list of subscribed subreddits
- API gets top/hot posts of each subreddit and stores that data
- API gets other relevant/useful data (do research to decide what this is)

## Data Analysis
- each subreddit gets a rating of how similar it is to the other subreddits
- and a rating of how aligned it is with the users overall alignment/taste

## Data Visualisation Concept
- subreddits are displayed as bubbles and are connected by lines to their most similar subreddits, forming islands
- dissimilar subreddits are on separate islands
- bubbles should be labelled, hovering over a line might show more specific details of the link
- bubbles should be color-coded based on... political leaning or similarity to users overall alignment?

## Data entry on website
- survey that cycles to a new question after one is answered
- entry box where you can type in subreddit names and add them
- list of added subreddits that allows you to delete unwanted ones
